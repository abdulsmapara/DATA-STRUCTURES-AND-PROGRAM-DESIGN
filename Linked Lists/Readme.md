Assignments on Linked Lists-
<ul>
  <li>
    Bank Transactions
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>
        Debit,Credit,abort and related operations to simulate bank transactions.
        <br />
    </li>
   </ul>
   </li>
  <li>
      Bucket Sort
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sorting a set of strings of same length(can be extended for variable length strings).
          <br />
          Time Complexity: O(n*k), where n=number of strings and k=length of string
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Number Representation
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Number Representation and supporting operations(Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication) using Linked Lists.
        <br />
        Implemented by storing a digit of a number in each node.Efficient way is to represent numbers till INT_MAX in each node
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Priority Queue
    <ul>
      <li>
          Created array of linked lists to support insert/delete efficiently from priority queue given a priority number.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Sparse Matrix
      <ul>
        <li>
        Matrix to use space efficiently which do not store 0 (null) values.
        In this implementation, Read and Add operations are supported.(Can be enhanced to support any operation on matrices)
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
